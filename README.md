# Hey, Iâ€™m Mitchell ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a remote-first IT Support Specialist with hands-on experience across Tier 1 and Tier 2 Windows support, SaaS troubleshooting, and API log analysis. Iâ€™ve worked with platforms like QuickBooks Desktop and on platforms like Hubspot and Salesforce 

This GitHub is where I document mock bug reports, reproduce platform issues, and simulate technical support cases â€” from webhook payload errors to Event Viewer log analysis and so on. I recreate support workflows through my own GitHub-based support labs and upload them here. These labs reflect the structured troubleshooting and internal documentation practices Iâ€™ve used in real and simulated environments

If you have any questions or constructive critism about my work, feel free to share that here with me!
