# Hey, I’m Mitchell 👋

I’m now focused specifically on cybersecurity SaaS because the problems are urgent and measurable—reducing risk, supporting audit readiness, and helping security teams operationalize trust. I’m building fluency in the language security buyers care about (vulnerability/remediation outcomes, compliance drivers like PCI/SOC 2) so I can prospect and qualify with relevance.
